Note that any use is under your responsibility.


If you use the partial one, it will download in batches of around ~230MB per part. 
This is useful if you don't have stable internet connection and cannot wait for the entire ~2.3GB video  (3 Hours).


If your internet connection is stable, it is better to use the the full downloader.


To use:

Go to the relevant video, in the network section (web-browser developer mode) find the serial sequence of the video. 
Paste the link to the list and run. 

You can download multiply videos in parallel. 


This should only be used for personal use, as long as you have the original access to the video. 

Note that any use is under your responsibility.
